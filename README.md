# Library Data Product Development

## Project Brief

A library wants to improve their current quality analysis, as manually completing the task takes too much time and is less reliable. They are looking for a more efficient way to filter data using Python and automation. They have heard of a tool called Azure DevOps and want to apply it to their process.
